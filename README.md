Annotated Dataset: Adverse Events following COVID-19 vaccines from Social Media and VAERS

This dataset comprises annotated data on adverse events (AEs) following COVID-19 vaccination, sourced from VAERS, Twitter, and Reddit. It includes 230 reports from VAERS, 3,383 tweets, and 49 Reddit posts. The dataset focuses on personal experiences of both short-term and long-term AEs, with named entity annotations for "vaccine," "shot," and "ae," supporting research in vaccine safety, public health monitoring, and biomedical natural language processing.
